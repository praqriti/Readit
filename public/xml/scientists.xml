<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just created a new subreddit for the purpose of engaging in productive discussion regarding efforts to globally eradicate infectious diseases. As a species, we have already had two major triumphs – both smallpox and rinderpest have been forever eliminated. However, current efforts to eradicate polio are stagnating, and few people are talking seriously about beginning new eradication campaigns.</p> <p>Reddit is full of scientists and young professionals. I hope this subreddit will be an opportunity to educate ourselves and others about the triumphs and tribulations associated with these projects. So please, if you have expertise or merely interest in these victories that will impact all future generations, come and share your knowledge or questions:</p> <p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/EradicationThinkTank" >http://www.reddit.com/r/EradicationThinkTank</a></p></div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/anriar"> anriar </a> <br/> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/scientists/comments/jh8yj/hey_scientists_do_you_have_expertise_in_a/">[link]</a> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/scientists/comments/jh8yj/hey_scientists_do_you_have_expertise_in_a/">[comment]</a>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Why is it that when you combine two Hydrogen atoms with an Oxygen atom you get something called Water that can put out fire, rather then an explosive? We know hydrogen is explosive, and that to fuel a fire you need oxygen so logically couldn't a person conclude that combing the two would result in something like an explosion if lighted rather then putting out fire? Just something that popped into my mind last night while taking a shower and I couldn't think of an answer so I now turn to you.</p></div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/LettersFromTheSky"> LettersFromTheSky </a> <br/> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/scientists/comments/jbrr3/trivial_question_for_chemists_of_reddit/">[link]</a> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/scientists/comments/jbrr3/trivial_question_for_chemists_of_reddit/">[6 comments]</a>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey, not sure if this is the proper subreddit, but the question didn't seem fitting for askscience.</p> <p>So I've been working on running 2D TLC of DNA bases on PET backed cellulose plates. I'm having issues with two of the bases though, Guanine and Hydroxymethyluracil. In solvent two both separate into two spots as opposed to one individual spot.</p> <p>My solvents are Solvent 1 - 70 mL methanol, 20 mL conc. HCl, 10 mL H2O Solvent 2 - 60 mL n-butanol, 20 mL methanol, 20 mL H2O, 1 mL NH4OH</p> <p>Bases are greater than or equal to 97% pure powder form and dissolved in either DI water or TE buffer. To dissolve Guanine the solution must be slightly acidified with HCl. I have tried replacing solvent 1 with just water per a paper that I can't find a link to at the moment with no success.</p> <p>Any suggestions or ideas on what may be going on here would be great.
