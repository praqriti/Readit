<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I hope I posted this in the right place (sorry if I didn't, haven't done much of any posting on Reddit)</p> <p>Anyways, I work in a really busy restaurant where we are getting calls all throughout service and a lot of the time they need to be directed to the kitchen (which is a different landline number entirely). Is there any way to set something up so when someone calls the restaurant's main number, they could be immediately greeted with some sort of numeric directory (i.e. press 1 for reservations and the call will go to hostess, press 2 for kitchen and call will be directed to kitchen, so on and so forth). Does anyone have any ideas?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am in the process of moving and have an entertainment system that needs to be disassembled in order to fit the space available for my moving truck. The entertainment system is made of many pieces, a la an Ikea product.</p> <p>In particular, there are several metal "screws" on the system that I can only describe as "locking screws." It is a flat, cylindrical piece with a Phillips head etching on top. On the curved side of this piece is a hole. The idea is that the cylindrical "screw" is popped into a hole made in panel A of the entertainment system. On a second piece, "panel B" is a standard variety screw. The idea is that the screw for panel B slides into the hole in the odd cylindrical "screw" of panel A. You then use a Phillips head screwdriver to turn the cylindrical screw clockwise. By doing this, the cylindrical screw and plain screw lock together. You can then tighten the cylindrical screw further, ensuring the lock is firm.</p> <p>I have no idea what this particular piece of hardware is called, but I <em>do</em> know that I desperately need to unlock several of these. Simply "unscrewing" the cylindrical piece is proving unsuccessful. I seem to be able to "loosen" it, but not necessarily unlock the pieces, allowing me to separate panel A from panel B.</p> <p>Does anyone with a knack for carpentry of hardware know how to help?</p> <p>Pictures are available to make this easier to visualize:</p> <p><a href="http://imgur.com/zhICL" >First</a></p> <p><a href="http://imgur.com/v3Pxb" >Second</a></p></div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/MrSynth"> MrSynth </a> <br/> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/howto/comments/jnldc/how_can_i_remove_this_hardware_from_a_piece_of/">[link]</a> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/howto/comments/jnldc/how_can_i_remove_this_hardware_from_a_piece_of/">[12 comments]</a>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I get hot all the time. It could be the dead of winter, but I’m still hot. It probably has to do with wearing dress pants and a button up shirt most days. I walk or ride my bike to work and am usually sweating by the time I get to work. Then it’s just stuffy enough in the office to keep me sweaty all day.</p> <p>It doesn’t help that I sit most of the day. The chair doesn’t breathe and my pants seem to form a sauna.</p> <p>I’ve always suffered from “swamp ass”. I’ve tried everything. Here are a few things I’ve done to stop it.</p> <p>A cold burst – End your shower with a cold burst. A lot of times I get out of a hot shower and am actually sweating. It seems like I can never stop sweating in the morning if I do this. I love hot showers, but have to have a cold burst at the end to cool off. Then I dry off and stay dry. Which leads me to…</p> <p>Start dry – After showering in the morning, make sure that you’re completely dried off down there. Use a blow dryer if you have to. This makes a huge difference. If you start the day damp, then throw on some stuffy pants, you’ll never get dry on your own. Then once you’re dry apply…</p> <p>Gold Bond – Gold Bond is basically baby powder for adults. It has menthol in it and feels like sitting on a block of ice. Make sure you’re dry when you sprinkle some on though or else you’ll have a mess. Gold Bond is best used with…</p> <p>Moisture wicking underwear – Get the good kind. I always grew up wearing regular boxers. They’d bunch up and be a sweaty mess. Then someone told me about moisture wicking boxer briefs. I tried them out and never went back. They keep you cool, reduce chafing, and are very comfortable. All of these things work, but are nothing compared to having…</p> <p>A fan – This is by far the best way to keep cool all day and avoid swamp ass. I bought a small desk fan the other day and it’s amazing. Everybody should have one of these at their desks. The thing was six bucks, but has completely changed my life. There’s just something about having a constant breeze on me that makes a huge difference. It keeps me cool and keeps the air from feeling stuffy.</p> <p>Any other ideas?</p> <p><a href="http://survivingthecubicle.com/2011/08/09/how-to-cure-swamp-ass/" >http://survivingthecubicle.com/2011/08/09/how-to-cure-swamp-ass/</a></p></div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/leevs11"> leevs11 </a> <br/> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/howto/comments/jduku/how_to_cure_swamp_ass/">[link]</a> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/howto/comments/jduku/how_to_cure_swamp_ass/">[113 comments]</a>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello r/hvac! First time posting here, but I don't know where to turn. I apologize in advance for the lengthy post that's about to follow, but I feel you need all the information to help. I just moved into a 2b/2b with a loft. The loft gives the living room a vaulted ceiling, which obviously isn't an ideal setup for AC, especially since the tstat is in the living room. For the whole month of june, the AC was working fantastically. We like to keep it really chilly (don't tell /r/frugal please :) ), usually at 70-72deg f. The AC had no problem keeping up.</p> <p>After the first electric bill came in, I immediately went out and bought a programable thermostat because I'm cheap but want to stay comfortable, and my fiance, to say the least, is not cheap. So I installed the programmable thermostat with what seemed like no issue.</p> <p>A few days after that, I noticed it wasn't cooling quite as well in here. The new Tstat was reporting 80deg f, but I read online that this thermostat occasionally bugs and the displayed temperature doesn't refresh. A quick battery pull fixes it, so I did that. Despite that, I never saw it get below 76 deg c. Over last weekend I noticed it getting significantly warmer. So I called maintenance and the maintenance supervisor himself came out and looked at my compressor outside. It had completely frozen over. He knocked off the ice, recharged it since it was out of freon, said it could be a couple days to get freon flowing through the system good again, and was on his way.</p> <p>It was a LITTLE better, but still no where near as good as it was last month. It IS hotter than last month (90's now vs. 80's then). He told me I actually have a pretty new unit, 4 years old, 3 ton unit (for about 1300 sq. feet). I called him again and told him things still weren't right. It was still hot in here. he came out and measured the temperatures and checked the flow of the pipes in the ac closet (by feeling the pipes, which are cold, and you can feel freon flowing). The vents were putting out 60 deg f air (we'd set the temp really low to test). he told me everything was fine and it might just take a few days for the freon to cool the place since the huge living room stores heat well.</p> <p>I've had him come out twice since then, he's monitored it throughout the week, and he swears up and down that the unit is fine, and it's just the heat outside keeping it warm in here. But the unit is rated for 20 degrees, so even when it's 90 outside (like it is right now), we should be able to get it to 70-75 no problem. It's 84 in here right now according to my 2nd thermometer. I placed the old thermostat back on the wall to see if the new thermostat was causing the problem. No change. Here's where I finally noticed something. When sitting in the bathroom (which is on the other side of the wall from the AC closet), I can hear the part which vibrates when turned on (Another maintenance guy told me this was the blower motor. correct?) kick on for a couple seconds, start to vibrate, then putter out. I had never heard/felt that before when the AC was working fine in June.</p> <p>I had the maintenance guy come in again earlier tonight. this marks the 5th or so time he's looked at it. he is CLEARLY very annoyed with me, which I can understand, but damnit, I pay a lot of money to live here, I expect service calls to get completed. I had him listen to the sound. He checked the pipe again, which was still cold, and said it was just the AC unit doing it's thing and that I probably didn't hear it in june because I was so low on freon.</p> <p>Which makes NO sense because it was working then. If it was so low on freon that it wasn't working properly, I wouldn'tve been able to get the ac from 80 deg f to 68-70 deg f for a month like I did. The maintenance guy told me he'd make me a deal: If I didn't trust his answer, he'd hire another licenced contractor (he's licensed for AC units, and everyone I've talked to swears he is THE AC guy in the complex) to come look at the unit, and if there was a problem, they'd pay for the costs, but if he was right and the inspector said nothing was wrong, I'd have to pay for it.</p> <p>1) So for my first question, how much would this cost if I'm wrong? I know the Loft doesn't provide for a great area to cool, but I CAN'T believe that a 10 degree difference outside would lead the AC to just work so poorly. For the record, when it's dead of night and only 70 outside, the place does get down to 68. I can feel cold air coming out of the vent, although the flow is not very strong. So if my hunch is correct, and the AC is working but the blower motor is shot, this would make sense, right? The air would be cool but if it's not coming out fast enough it'd get heated up before having a chance to cool anything.</p> <p>2) Is there any set of fuses/transistors/capacitors I can open a panel to check? I would LOVE if all I'd have to do is swap a fuse or something. I've checked the fuse box for the apartment and nothing is tripped.</p> <p>3) If there's anyone in the SE Michigan area that wouldn't mind coming to look at it, I would love to discuss fees with you. I'd rather not upset management since I'm still new here and I DO really appreciate his patience with me.</p> <p>Anyone have any suggestions? I'd LOVE some help here! Thank you!</p> <p>EDIT 1: The maintenance guy did also replace the air filter.</p> <p>EDIT 2: Thank you everyone for the fantastic responses. I love reddit. I got home today around 130 and the fan seems to be working properly now. The house is nice and cool at 73 deg f. I have NO clue what happened. No one came in. We'd left it running in case the maintenance guy decided to check on it, and I'm glad we did because now I'm nice and comfortable. I spoke with the office manager and she said to definitely still let them know if it starts acting up again, and they'll send someone. They really are nice people and want to make sure I'm satisfied, the maintenance guy was just stumped as to what I thought there was a problem.</p> <p>So at least, for now, the issue is resolved.</p> <p>TL;DR: AC is not cooling 2b2b apartment with loft. Maintenance says it's just the heat (90-95deg average). Freon levels have been checked. Blower motor sounds like it's dying when trying to kick on (I NEVER hear the full vibration of the closet).</p></div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/b1ackcat"> b1ackcat </a> <br/> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/howto/comments/j57tl/ac_on_the_fritz_anything_i_can_check_xpost_from/">[link]</a> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/howto/comments/j57tl/ac_on_the_fritz_anything_i_can_check_xpost_from/">[25 comments]</a>
