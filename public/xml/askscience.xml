<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><strong>Calling all scientists!</strong></p> <p>The previous thread expired! If you are already on the panel - no worries - you'll stay! This thread is for <strong>new</strong> panelist recruitment!</p> <p><strong>Please make a comment to this thread to join our panel of scientists. (click the reply button) </strong></p> <p>The panel is an informal group of Redditors who are professional scientists (or plan on becoming one, with at least a graduate-level familiarity with the field of their choice). The purpose of the panel is to add a certain degree of reliability to AskScience answers. Anybody can answer any question, of course, but if a particular answer is posted by a member of the panel, we hope it'll be recognized as more reliable or trustworthy than the average post by an arbitrary redditor. You obviously still need to consider that any answer here is coming from the internet so check sources and apply critical thinking as per usual.</p> <p>You may want to join the panel if you:</p> <ul> <li><p>Are a research scientist professionally, are working at a post-doctoral capacity, are working on your PhD, are working on a science-related MS, or have gathered a large amount of science-related experience through work.</p></li> <li><p>Are willing to subscribe to /r/AskScience.</p></li> <li><p>Are happy to answer questions that the ignorant masses may pose about your field.</p></li> <li><p>Are able to write about your field at a layman's level as well as at a level comfortable to your colleagues and peers (depending on who's asking the question)</p></li> </ul> <p>You're still reading? Excellent! Here's what you do:</p> <ul> <li><p>Make a top-level comment to this post.</p></li> <li><p>State your general field (see the legend in the side bar)</p></li> <li><p>State your specific field (neuropathology, quantum chemistry, etc.)</p></li> <li><p>List your particular research interests (carbon nanotube dielectric properties, myelin sheath degradation in Parkinsons patients, etc.)</p></li> </ul> <p>We're not going to do background checks - we're just asking for Reddit's best behavior here. The information you provide will be used to compile a list of our panel members and what subject areas they'll be "responsible" for.</p> <p>The reason I'm asking for top-level comments is that I'll get a little orange envelope from each of you, which will help me keep track of the whole thing. These official threads are also here for book-keeping: the other moderators and I can check what your claimed credentials are, and can take action if it becomes clear you're bullshitting us.</p> <p><strong>Bonus points!</strong> Here's a good chance to discover people that share your interests! And if you're interested in something, you probably have questions about it, so you can get started with that in /r/AskScience.</p> <p>/r/AskScience isn't just for lay people with a passing interest to ask questions they can find answers to in Wikipedia - it's also a hub for discussing open questions in science. (No pseudo-science, though: don't argue stuff most scientists consider bunk!)</p> <p>I'm expecting panel members and the community as a whole to discuss difficult topics amongst themselves in a way that makes sense to them, as well as performing the general tasks of informing the masses, promoting public understanding of scientific topics, and raising awareness of misinformation.</p></div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/TheWalruss"> TheWalruss </a> <br/> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/jwibi/askscience_panel_of_scientists_iv/">[link]</a> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/jwibi/askscience_panel_of_scientists_iv/">[199 comments]</a>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/jwi0f/night_sky_sighting_that_i_cannot_identify/" >Here is the original post</a>.</p> <p>I was biking home from a festival, heading east, in Groningen, the Netherlands. At approximately 00:05 today on 28-8-2011, I looked up and noticed a bright reddish blob in the sky, at about 45 degrees from the horizon.</p> <p>At first I thought it was a hot-air balloon or chinese lantern, so I pulled off onto the sidewalk to have a better look. At this point, I notice it is moving a bit slower than a satellite would be, faster than a hot-air balloon at that distance, and didn't move like a chinese lantern in the wind. As it moved further east, towards the horizon, it faded in intensity, changed to a more yellow hue, and then disappeared entirely. The whole event from discovery to disappearance lasted about 60 seconds.</p> <p>After it was gone, I thought it was an iridium flare. I have seen them before, and the fading out was very similar, except the color was just nuts. Heavens-Above tells me it was certainly not an iridium flare, nor the ISS. Apparently a magnitude -8 is coming straight over-head at 04:00 tonight, but I can't convince my wife to stay up to watch it...</p> <p>Anyway, what do you think it might have been? My suspicion is that it's actually a chinese lantern after all. Has anybody seen one at a great distance? Could it be some other satellite? It didn't look like any meteor I've ever seen or seen videos of, and was so very slow... I'm really at a loss!</p></div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/TheWalruss"> TheWalruss </a> <br/> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/jww1l/xpost_from_astronomy_night_sky_sighting_that_i/">[link]</a> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/jww1l/xpost_from_astronomy_night_sky_sighting_that_i/">[3 comments]</a>

Since we've moved in, we've caught at least 6 of these buggers and released them back into the wild. We usually trap them under a tupperwear container, slide a magazine underneath, and go running back into the back yard screaming like little girls to release them. One of the ones today lost the tip of his tail when we trapped him (and it flailed about on its own disconnected... eek!)</p> <p>I'd rather not have to pay some exterminator to come out and spray a toxic chemical inside and outside of the house (we have a dog), but we're just about to that point. We caught two separate ones today and we are beyond frustrated.</p> <p>We're not sure how they are getting in, either. We have three entrances to the house: front door, back door, and the door that leads in from the garage. I've never seen one come in when we came in. We have sprayed anti-pest spray there as a deterrent, and we did get a bag of chemical pellets to spread around the perimeter of the house. I don't notice any significant holes in the house or along the foundation of the house, but that doesn't mean they are there.</p> <p>My understanding is they come in to moist environments, but we have no water problems that I am aware of. (Home inspector didn't find any, either.) We do have a large storm drain to the left side of our yard between our house and our neighbor's house, but you'd think they would go there for water.</p> <p>Thanks in advance for your help in deterring these guys from hanging out with us again.</p> <p>TL;DR how do we stop these <del>salamanders</del> skinks from coming inside our house?</p> <p>Edit: Per Wikipedia: <strong><em>"Fertilization in five-lined skinks is internal, with eggs laid by the female between the middle of May and July, at least one month after mating."</em></strong> So could we have the eggs somewhere in our house? Or more likely out in the woods and they're coming in to visit?</p></div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/kmully"> kmully </a> <br/> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/jwc1d/my_wife_and_i_have_lived_in_our_house_for_2/">[link]</a> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/jwc1d/my_wife_and_i_have_lived_in_our_house_for_2/">[69 comments]</a>

I love to know the history behind how we know what we do. Like how gravitational lensing was used to show that dark matter existed. I created /r/HowDoWeKnow to highlight answers to these questions.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This will probably be pretty basic for some of the better educated redditors out there, but I'm very much a layman on the subject who wants to know more. I'm not trying to discount any theory or anything. I simply want to know the explanation.</p> <p>If the redshift of light from distant galaxies suggests that the universe is expanding, why doesn't gravitational redshift come into the discussion? It seems to me that the further a galaxy is from us, the light coming from it would be affected more by gravity, due to the time and distance it had to travel. Would the light not have more gravitational redshift if the galaxy is farther away? I know that gravity's affect is the square of the distance. So, does the gravitational redshift go away over distance or does it increase, only less and less as the light travels away from the gravitational force? Once the light is red-shifted does it shift back toward the blue or normal wavelengths as it travels away from the source? Wouldn't there have to a be force in the opposite direction to counter the redshift?</p></div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/lpcustom"> lpcustom </a> <br/> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/jwws1/a_question_about_gravitational_redshift/">[link]</a> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/jwws1/a_question_about_gravitational_redshift/">[1 comment]</a>
